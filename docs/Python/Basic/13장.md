<!-- Programmers devote a surprising amount of effort to dates and times. Let’s talk about

some of the problems they encounter and then get to some best practices and tricks

to make the situation a little less messy.

Dates can be represented in many ways—too many ways, actually. Even in English

with the Roman calendar, you’ll see many variants of a simple date:

- July 21 1987
- 21 Jul 1987
- 21/7/1987
- 7/21/1987

Among other problems, date representations can be ambiguous. In the previous

examples, it’s easy to determine that 7 stands for the month and 21 is the day of the

month, because months don’t go to 21. But how about 1/6/2012? Is that referring to

January 6 or June 1?

The month name varies by language within the Roman calendar. Even the year and

month can have a different definition in other cultures.

### 247


Times have their own sources of grief, especially because of time zones and daylight

savings time. If you look at a time zone map, the zones follow political and historic

boundaries rather than crisp lines every 15 degrees (360 degrees / 24) of longitude.

And countries start and end daylight savings times on different days of the year.

Southern hemisphere countries advance their clocks as their northern friends are

winding theirs back, and vice versa.

Python’s standard library has many date and time modules, including: datetime,

time, calendar, dateutil, and others. There’s some overlap, and it’s a bit confusing. -->

<!-- There’s some overlap, and it’s a bit confusing. -->

## Leap Year(윤년)

<!-- Leap years are a special wrinkle in time. You probably know that every four years is a

leap year (and the summer Olympics and the American presidential election). Did

you also know that every 100 years is not a leap year, but that every 400 years is?

Here’s code to test various years for leapiness: -->

윤년은 특정한 시간 주기다.

```
>>> import calendar
>>> calendar.isleap(1900)
False
>>> calendar.isleap(1996)
True
>>> calendar.isleap(1999)
False
>>> calendar.isleap(2000)
True
>>> calendar.isleap(2002)
False
>>> calendar.isleap(2004)
True
```
For the curious:

{: .note}
> - A year has 365.242196 days (after one spin around the sun, the earth is about a quarter-turn on its axis from where it started).
- Add one day every four years. Now an average year has 365.242196 – 0.25 = 364.992196 days
- Subtract a day every 100 years. Now an average year has 364.992196 + 0.01 = 365.002196 days
- Add a day every 400 years. Now an average year has 365.002196 – 0.0025 = 364.999696 days

Close enough for now! We will not speak of leap seconds.


## The datetime Module

The standard datetime module handles (which should not be a surprise) dates and times. It defines four main object classes, each with many methods:

- `date` : years, months, and days
- `time` : hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions
- `datetime` : dates, times
- `timedelta` : date and/or time intervals

You can make a date object by specifying a year, month, and day. Those values are then available as attributes:

<!-- ```
>>> from datetime import date
>>> halloween = date(2019, 10, 31)
>>> halloween
datetime.date(2019, 10, 31)
>>> halloween.day
31
>>> halloween.month
10
>>> halloween.year
2019
```
You can print a date with its isoformat() method:

```
>>> halloween.isoformat()
'2019-10-31'
```
The iso refers to ISO 8601, an international standard for representing dates and

times. It goes from most general (year) to most specific (day). Because of this, it also

sorts correctly: by year, then month, then day. I usually choose this format for date

representation in programs, and for filenames that save data by date. The next section

describes the more complex strptime() and strftime() methods for parsing and

formatting dates.

This example uses the today() method to generate today’s date:

```
>>> from datetime import date
>>> now = date.today()
>>> now
datetime.date(2019, 4, 5)
```
This one makes use of a timedelta object to add some time interval to a date:

```
>>> from datetime import timedelta
>>> one_day = timedelta(days=1)
>>> tomorrow = now + one_day
>>> tomorrow
```

```
datetime.date(2019, 4, 6)
>>> now + 17*one_day
datetime.date(2019, 4, 22)
>>> yesterday = now - one_day
>>> yesterday
datetime.date(2019, 4, 4)
```
The range of date is from date.min (year=1, month=1, day=1) to date.max

(year=9999, month=12, day=31). As a result, you can’t use it for historic or astronom‐

ical calculations.

The datetime module’s time object is used to represent a time of day:

```
>>> from datetime import time
>>> noon = time(12, 0, 0)
>>> noon
datetime.time(12, 0)
>>> noon.hour
12
>>> noon.minute
0
>>> noon.second
0
>>> noon.microsecond
0
```
The arguments go from the largest time unit (hours) to the smallest (microseconds).

If you don’t provide all the arguments, time assumes all the rest are zero. By the way,

just because you can store and retrieve microseconds doesn’t mean you can retrieve

time from your computer to the exact microsecond. The accuracy of subsecond

measurements depends on many factors in the hardware and operating system.

The datetime object includes both the date and time of day. You can create one

directly, such as the one that follows, which is for January 2, 2019, at 3:04 A.M., plus 5

seconds and 6 microseconds:

```
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> some_day = datetime(2019, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
>>> some_day
datetime.datetime(2019, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```
The datetime object also has an isoformat() method:

```
>>> some_day.isoformat()
'2019-01-02T03:04:05.000006'
```
That middle T separates the date and time parts.

datetime has a now() method to return the current date and time:

```
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> now = datetime.now()
>>> now
```

```
1 This starting point is roughly when Unix was born, ignoring those pesky leap seconds.
```
```
datetime.datetime(2019, 4, 5, 19, 53, 7, 580562)
>>> now.year
2019
>>> now.month
4
>>> now.day
5
>>> now.hour
19
>>> now.minute
53
>>> now.second
7
>>> now.microsecond
580562
```
You can combine() a date object and a time object into a datetime:

```
>>> from datetime import datetime, time, date
>>> noon = time(12)
>>> this_day = date.today()
>>> noon_today = datetime.combine(this_day, noon)
>>> noon_today
datetime.datetime(2019, 4, 5, 12, 0)
```
You can yank the date and time from a datetime by using the date() and time()

methods:

```
>>> noon_today.date()
datetime.date(2019, 4, 5)
>>> noon_today.time()
datetime.time(12, 0)
``` -->

```python
from datetime import date
halloween = date(2019, 10, 31)
print(halloween) # datetime.date(2019, 10, 31)
print(halloween.day) # 31

now = date.today()
print(now)         # 오늘 날짜 출력

from datetime import timedelta
delta = timedelta(days=1)
tomorrow = now + delta
print('now : %s, tomorrow : %s'%(now,tomorrow))
print(now + 17*delta)  # 17일 후

# 타임 다루기
from datetime import time
noon = time(12, 0, 0)
print(noon) # datetime.time(12, 0)
print(noon.hour) # 12

from datetime import datetime
some_day = datetime(2019, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) #마지막인수 - 마이크로초
print(some_day)  # datetime.datetime(2019, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
iso = some_day.isoformat()  # datetime자료형 -> 인식 가능 하게
print(iso) # 2019-01-02T03:04:05.000006

now = datetime.now()
print(now)  # 2022-12-30 22:09:49.004540
print(now.year) # 2022

d = some_day.date() # date부분만 추출
print(d)            # 2019-01-02
s = some_day.time() # time부분만 추출
print(s) # 03:04:05.000006

con = datetime.combine(d,s) # date, time -> datetime으로
print(con)                  # 2019-01-02 03:04:05.000006
```


## Using the time Module

<!-- It is confusing that Python has a datetime module with a time object, and a separate time module. Furthermore, the time module has a function called—wait for it-time().

One way to represent an absolute time is to count the number of seconds since some starting point. Unix time uses the number of seconds since midnight on January 1, 1970. This value is often called the epoch, and it is often the simplest way to exchange dates and times among systems. -->
유닉스 계열의 시간 개념 (다른 시스템과 교환 가능): 1970/1/1 자정 이후의 초를 사용한다 - epoch값

The time module’s time() function returns the current time as an epoch value:

```
>>> import time
>>> now = time.time()
```

```
>>> now
1554512132.778233
```
More than one billion seconds have ticked by since New Year’s, 1970. Where did the time go?

You can convert an epoch value to a string by using ctime():

```
>>> time.ctime(now)
'Fri Apr 5 19:55:32 2019'
```
In the next section, you’ll see how to produce more attractive formats for dates and times.
Epoch values are a useful least-common denominator for date and time exchange with different systems, such as JavaScript. Sometimes, though, you need actual days, hours, and so forth, which time provides as struct_time objects. localtime() provides the time in your system’s time zone, and gmtime() provides it in UTC:

```
>>> time.localtime(now)
time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=4, tm_mday=5, tm_hour=19,
tm_min=55, tm_sec=32, tm_wday=4, tm_yday=95, tm_isdst=1)
>>> time.gmtime(now)
time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=4, tm_mday=6, tm_hour=0,
tm_min=55, tm_sec=32, tm_wday=5, tm_yday=96, tm_isdst=0)
```
My 19:55 (Central time zone, Daylight Savings) was 00:55 in the next day in UTC (formerly called Greenwich time or Zulu time). If you omit the argument to local time() or gmtime(), they assume the current time.
Some of the tm_... values in struct_time are a bit ambiguous, so take a look at Table 13-1 for more details.

Table 13-1. _struct_time_ values

<div class="code-example11" markdown="1">

| Index | Name     | Meaning           | Values                        |
|:------|:---------|:------------------|:------------------------------|
| 0     | tm_year  | Year              | 0000 to 9999                  | 
| 1     | tm_mon   | Month             | 1 to 12                       | 
| 2     | tm_mday  | Day of month      | 1 to 31                       | 
| 3     | tm_hour  | Hour              | 0 to 23                       | 
| 4     | tm_min   | Minute            | 0 to 59                       | 
| 5     | tm_sec   | Second            | 0 to 61                       | 
| 6     | tm_wday  | Day of week       | 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday)      | 
| 7     | tm_yday  | Day of year       | 1 to 366                      | 
| 8     | tm_isdst | Daylight savings? | 0 = no, 1 = yes, -1 = unknown | 

</div>

If you don’t want to type all those tm_... names, struct_time also acts like a named tuple (see “Named Tuples” on page 195 ), so you can use the indexes from the previous table:

```
>>> import time
>>> now = time.localtime()
>>> now
time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=6, tm_mday=23, tm_hour=12,
tm_min=12, tm_sec=24, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=174, tm_isdst=1)
>>> now[0]
2019
print(list(now[x] for x in range(9)))
[2019, 6, 23, 12, 12, 24, 6, 174, 1]
```
mktime() goes in the other direction, converting a struct_time object to epoch seconds:

```
>>> tm = time.localtime(now)
>>> time.mktime(tm)
1554512132.0
```
This doesn’t exactly match our earlier epoch value of now() because the struct_time object preserves time only to the second.

```
Some advice: wherever possible, use UTC instead of time zones.
UTC is an absolute time, independent of time zones. If you have a server, set its time to UTC; do not use local time.
More advice: never use daylight savings time if you can avoid it. If you use daylight savings time, an hour disappears at one time of year (“spring ahead”) and occurs twice at another time (“fall back”).
For some reason, many organizations use local time with daylight savings in their computer systems, but are mystified twice every year by that spooky hour.
```
## Read and Write Dates and Times

isoformat() is not the only way to write dates and times. You already saw the ctime() function in the time module, which you can use to convert epochs to strings:

```
>>> import time
>>> now = time.time()
>>> time.ctime(now)
'Fri Apr 5 19:58:23 2019'
```
You can also convert dates and times to strings by using strftime(). This is provided as a method in the datetime, date, and time objects, and as a function in the time module. strftime() uses format strings to specify the output, which you can see in Table 13-2.


Table 13-2. Output specifiers for strftime()
<div class="code-example" markdown="1">

| Format string | Date/time unit | Range        |
|:--------------|:---------------|:-------------|
| %Y            | year           | 1900 -...    |
| %m            | month          | 01 - 12      |
| %B            | month name     | January, ... |
| %b            | month abbrev   | Jan, ...     |
| %d            | day of month   | 01 - 31      |
| %A            | weekday name   | Sunday, ...  |
| a             | weekday abbrev | Sun, ...     |
| %H            | hour (24 hr)   | 00 - 23      |
| %I            | hour (12 hr)   | 01 - 12      |
| %p            | AM/PM          | AM, PM       |
| %M            | minute         | 00 - 59      |
| %S            | second         | 00 - 59      |

</div>

Numbers are zero-padded on the left.

Here’s the strftime() function provided by the time module. It converts a struct_time object to a string. We’ll first define the format string fmt and use it again

later:

```
>>> import time
>>> fmt = "It's %A, %B %d, %Y, local time %I:%M:%S%p"
>>> t = time.localtime()
>>> t
time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=3, tm_mday=13, tm_hour=15,
tm_min=23, tm_sec=46, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=72, tm_isdst=1)
>>> time.strftime(fmt, t)
"It's Wednesday, March 13, 2019, local time 03:23:46PM"
```
If we try this with a date object, only the date parts will work, and the time defaults to

midnight:

```
>>> from datetime import date
>>> some_day = date(2019, 7, 4)
>>> fmt = "It's %A, %B %d, %Y, local time %I:%M:%S%p"
>>> some_day.strftime(fmt)
"It's Thursday, July 04, 2019, local time 12:00:00AM"
```
For a time object, only the time parts are converted:

```
>>> from datetime import time
>>> fmt = "It's %A, %B %d, %Y, local time %I:%M:%S%p"
>>> some_time = time(10, 35)
>>> some_time.strftime(fmt)
"It's Monday, January 01, 1900, local time 10:35:00AM"
```


You won’t want to use the day parts from a time object, because they’re meaningless.

To go the other way and convert a string to a date or time, use strptime() with the same format string. There’s no regular expression pattern matching; the nonformat parts of the string (without %) need to match exactly. Let’s specify a format that matches year-month-day, such as 2019-01-29. What happens if the date string you want to parse has spaces instead of dashes?

```
>>> import time
>>> fmt = "%Y-%m-%d"
>>> time.strptime("2019 01 29", fmt)
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>",
line 1, in <module>
File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/_strptime.py",
line 571, in _strptime_time
tt = _strptime(data_string, format)[0]
File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/_strptime.py",
line 359, in _strptime(data_string, format))
ValueError: time data '2019 01 29' does not match format '%Y-%m-%d
```
If we feed strptime() some dashes, is it happy now?

```
>>> import time
>>> fmt = "%Y-%m-%d"
>>> time.strptime("2019-01-29", fmt)
time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=29, tm_hour=0,
tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=29, tm_isdst=-1)
```
Or fix the fmt string to match the date string:

```
>>> import time
>>> fmt = "%Y %m %d"
>>> time.strptime("2019 01 29", fmt)
time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=29, tm_hour=0,
tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=29, tm_isdst=-1)
```
Even if the string seems to match its format, an exception is raised if a value is out of range (file names truncated for space):

```
>>> time.strptime("2019-13-29", fmt)
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>",
line 1, in <module>
File ".../3.7/lib/python3.7/_strptime.py",
line 571, in _strptime_time
tt = _strptime(data_string, format)[0]
File ".../3.7/lib/python3.7/_strptime.py",
line 359, in _strptime(data_string, format))
ValueError: time data '2019-13-29' does not match format '%Y-%m-%d
```
Names are specific to your locale—internationalization settings for your operating system. If you need to print different month and day names, change your locale by using setlocale(); its first argument is locale.LC_TIME for dates and times, and the second is a string combining the language and country abbreviation. Let’s invite some

international friends to a Halloween party. We’ll print the month, day, and day of week in US English, French, German, Spanish, and Icelandic (Icelanders have real elves):

```
>>> import locale
>>> from datetime import date
>>> halloween = date(2019, 10, 31)
>>> for lang_country in ['en_us', 'fr_fr', 'de_de', 'es_es', 'is_is',]:
... locale.setlocale(locale.LC_TIME, lang_country)
... halloween.strftime('%A, %B %d')
...
'en_us'
'Thursday, October 31'
'fr_fr'
'Jeudi, octobre 31'
'de_de'
'Donnerstag, Oktober 31'
'es_es'
'jueves, octubre 31'
'is_is'
'fimmtudagur, október 31'
>>>
```
Where do you find these magic values for lang_country? This is a bit wonky, but you can try this to get all of them (there are a few hundred):

```
>>> import locale
>>> names = locale.locale_alias.keys()
```
From names, let’s get just locale names that seem to work with setlocale(), such as the ones we used in the preceding example—a two-character language code followed by an underscore and a two-character country code:

```
>>> good_names = [name for name in names if \
len(name) == 5 and name[2] == '_']
```
What do the first five look like?

```
>>> good_names[:5]
['sr_cs', 'de_at', 'nl_nl', 'es_ni', 'sp_yu']
```
So, if you wanted all the German language locales, try this:

```
>>> de = [name for name in good_names if name.startswith('de')]
>>> de
['de_at', 'de_de', 'de_ch', 'de_lu', 'de_be']
```

```
If you run set_locale() and get the error locale.Error: unsupported locale setting that locale is not supported by your operating system. You’ll need
to figure out what your operating system needs to add it. This can happen even if Python told you (using locale.locale_alias.keys()) that it was a good locale. I had this error when testing on macOS with the locale cy_gb (Welsh, Great Britain), even though it had accepted is_is (Icelandic) in the preceding example.
```
