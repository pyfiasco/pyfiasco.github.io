**Py Art**

```
Well, art is art, isn’t it? Still, on the other hand, water is water! And east is east and west
is west, and if you take cranberries and stew them like applesauce, they taste much
more like prunes than rhubarb does.
—Groucho Marx
```
This chapter and the next two discuss the application of Python to some common

human endeavors: art, business, and science. If you’re interested in any of these areas,

you may get some helpful ideas or the urge to try something new.

### 2-D Graphics

All computer languages have been applied to computer graphics to some degree.

Many of the heavy-duty platforms in this chapter were written in C or C++ for speed,

but added Python libraries for productivity. Let’s begin by looking at some 2-D imag‐

ing libraries.

#### Standard Library

Only a few image-related modules are in the standard library:

imghdr

Detects the file type of some image files.

colorsys

Converts colors between various systems: RGB, YIQ, HSV, and HLS.

##### 453


If you downloaded the O’Reilly logo to a local file called oreilly.png, you could run

this:

```
>>> import imghdr
>>> imghdr.what('oreilly.png')
'png'
```
Another standard library is turtle—“Turtle graphics,” which is sometimes used to

teach programming to young people. You can run a demo with this command:

```
$ python -m turtledemo
```
Figure 20-1 shows a screenshot of its rosette example.

Figure 20-1. Image from turtledemo

To do anything serious with graphics in Python, we need to get some third-party

packages. Let’s see what’s out there.

#### PIL and Pillow

For many years, the Python Image Library (PIL), although not in the standard library,

has been Python’s best-known 2-D image processing library. It predated installers

such as pip, so a “friendly fork” called Pillow was created. Pillow’s imaging code is

backward-compatible with PIL, and its documentation is good, so let’s use it here.

Installation is simple; just type the following command:

```
$ pip install Pillow
```
**454 | Chapter 20: Py Art**


If you’ve already installed operating system packages such as libjpeg, libfreetype,

and zlib, they’ll be detected and used by Pillow. See the installation page for details

on this.

Open an image file:

```
>>> from PIL import Image
>>> img = Image.open('oreilly.png')
>>> img.format
'PNG'
>>> img.size
(154, 141)
>>> img.mode
'RGB'
```
Although the package is called Pillow, you import it as PIL to make it compatible

with the older PIL.

To display the image on your screen using the Image object’s show() method, you’ll

first need to install the ImageMagick package described in the next section, and then

try this:

```
>>> img.show()
```
The image displayed in Figure 20-2 opens in another window. (This screenshot was

captured on a Mac, where the show() function used the Preview application. Your

window’s appearance might vary.)

Figure 20-2. Image displayed with the Python Image Library

Let’s crop the image in memory, save the result as a new object called img2, and dis‐

play it. Images are always measured by horizontal (x) values and vertical (y) values,

with one corner of the image known as the origin and arbitrarily assigned an x and y

of 0. In this library, the origin (0, 0) is at the upper left of the image, x increases to the

```
2-D Graphics | 455
```

right, and y increases as you move down. We want to give the values of left x (55), top

y (70), right x (85), and bottom y (100) to the crop() method, so pass it a tuple with

those values in that order:

```
>>> crop = (55, 70, 85, 100)
>>> img2 = img.crop(crop)
>>> img2.show()
```
The results are shown in Figure 20-3.

Figure 20-3. The cropped image

Save an image file with the save method. It takes a filename and an optional type. If

the filename has a suffix, the library uses that to determine the type. But you can also

specify the type explicitly. To save our cropped image as a GIF file, do the following:

```
>>> img2.save('cropped.gif', 'GIF')
>>> img3 = Image.open('cropped.gif')
>>> img3.format
'GIF'
>>> img3.size
(30, 30)
```
For our last example, let’s “improve” our little mascot. First download copies of our

original critter, shown in Figure 20-4.

**456 | Chapter 20: Py Art**


Figure 20-4. Beloved ur-critter

He has a sort of scruffy five o’clock shadow, so let’s get an image to improve his, um,

image; see Figure 20-5.

Figure 20-5. Alien technology

Let’s put them together, with some alpha channel magic to make the overlap semi-

transparent, demonstrated in Example 20-1.

Example 20-1. ch20_critter.py

**from PIL import** Image

critter = Image.open('ch20_critter.png')
stache = Image.open('ch20_stache.png')
stache.putalpha(100)
img = Image.new('RGBA', critter.size, (255, 255, 255, 0))
img.paste(critter, (0, 0))
img.paste(stache, (45, 90), mask=stache)
img.show()

Figure 20-6 presents his makeover.

Figure 20-6. Our new, dapper mascot

#### ImageMagick

ImageMagick is a suite of programs to convert, modify, and display 2-D bitmap

images. It’s been around for more than 20 years. Various Python libraries have con‐

```
2-D Graphics | 457
```

nected to the ImageMagick C library. A recent one that supports Python 3 is wand.

To install it, type the following command:

```
$ pip install Wand
```
You can do many of the same things with wand as you can with Pillow:

```
>>> from wand.image import Image
>>> from wand.display import display
>>>
>>> img = Image(filename='oreilly.png')
>>> img.size
(154, 141)
>>> img.format
'PNG'
```
As with Pillow, this displays the image on the screen:

```
>>> display(img)
```
wand includes rotation, resizing, text and line drawing, format conversion, and other

features that you can also find in Pillow. Both have good APIs and documentation.

### 3-D Graphics

Some basic Python packages include the following:

- VPython has examples that can run in your browser.
- pi3d runs on the Raspberry Pi, Windows, Linux, and Android.
- Open3D is a full-featured 3-D library.

### 3-D Animation

Watch the long end-credits for almost any contemporary movie, and you’ll see mass

quantities of people doing special effects and animation. Most of the big studios—

Walt Disney Animation, ILM, Weta, Dreamworks, Pixar—hire people with Python

experience. Do a web search for “python animation jobs” to see what’s available now.

Some Python 3-D packages are:

Panda3D

```
It’s open source and free to use, even for commercial applications. You can down‐
load a version from the Panda3D website.
```
VPython

Comes with many examples.

**458 | Chapter 20: Py Art**


Blender

```
Blender is a free 3-D animation and game creator. When you download and
install it, it comes bundled with its own copy of Python 3.
```
Maya

```
This is a commercial 3-D animation and graphic system. It also comes bundled
with a version of Python, currently 2.7. Chad Vernon has written a free down‐
loadable book, Python Scripting for Maya Artists. If you search for Python and
Maya on the web, you’ll find many other resources, both free and commercial,
including videos.
```
Houdini

```
Houdini is commercial, although you can download a free version called
Apprentice. Like the other animation packages, it comes with a Python binding.
```
### Graphical User Interfaces

The name includes the word graphic, but graphical user interfaces (GUIs) concen‐

trate more on the user interface: widgets to present data, input methods, menus, but‐

tons, and windows to frame everything.

The GUI programming wiki page and FAQ list many Python-powered GUIs. Let’s

begin with the only one that’s built in to the standard library: Tkinter. It’s plain, but it

works on all platforms to produce native-looking windows and widgets.

Here’s a teeny, tiny Tkinter program to display our favorite googly-eyed mascot in a

window:

```
>>> import tkinter
>>> from PIL import Image, ImageTk
>>>
>>> main = tkinter.Tk()
>>> img = Image.open('oreilly.png')
>>> tkimg = ImageTk.PhotoImage(img)
>>> tkinter.Label(main, image=tkimg).pack()
>>> main.mainloop()
```
Notice that it used some modules from PIL/Pillow. You should see the O’Reilly logo

again, as shown in Figure 20-7.

```
Graphical User Interfaces | 459
```

Figure 20-7. Image displayed with Tkinter

To make the window go away, click its close button, or leave your Python interpreter.

You can read more about Tkinter at the tkinter wiki. Now for the GUIs that are not in

the standard library:

Qt

```
This is a professional GUI and application toolkit, originated about 20 years ago
by Trolltech in Norway. It’s been used to help build applications such as Google
Earth, Maya, and Skype. It was also used as the base for KDE, a Linux desktop.
There are two main Python libraries for Qt: PySide is free (LGPL license), and
PyQt is licensed either with the GPL or commercially. The Qt folks see these dif‐
ferences. Download PySide from PyPI or Qt and read the tutorial. You can
download Qt for free online.
```
GTK+

```
GTK+ is a competitor of Qt, and it, too, has been used to create many applica‐
tions, including GIMP and the Gnome desktop for Linux. The Python binding is
PyGTK. To download the code, go to the PyGTK site, where you can also read
the documents.
```
WxPython

```
This is the Python binding for WxWidgets. It’s another hefty package, free to
download online.
```
Kivy

```
Kivy is a free modern library for building multimedia user interfaces portably
across platforms—desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), and mobile (Android,
iOS). It includes multitouch support. You can download for all the platforms on
the Kivy website. Kivy includes application development tutorials.
```
PySimpleGUI

```
Write native or web-based GUIs with one library. PySimpleGUI is a wrapper for
some of the other GUIs mentioned in this section, including Tk, Kivy, and Qt.
```
**460 | Chapter 20: Py Art**


The web

```
Frameworks such as Qt use native components, but some others use the web.
After all, the web is a universal GUI, and it has graphics (SVG), text (HTML),
and even multimedia now (in HTML5). You can build web applications with any
combination of frontend (browser-based) and backend (web server) tools. A thin
client lets the backend do most of the work. If the frontend dominates, it’s a thick,
or fat, or rich client; the last adjective sounds more flattering. It’s common for the
sides to communicate with RESTful APIs, Ajax, and JSON.
```
### Plots, Graphs, and Visualization

Python has become a leading solution for plots, graphs, and data visualization. It’s

especially popular in science, which is covered in Chapter 22. Useful overviews, with

examples, include the official Python wiki and the Python Graph Gallery.

Let’s look at the most popular ones. In the next chapter, you’ll see some of these again,

but being used to create maps.

#### Matplotlib

The Matplotlib 2-D plotting library can be installed by using the following command:

```
$ pip install matplotlib
```
The examples in the gallery show the breadth of Matplotlib.

Let’s first try the same image display application (with results shown in Figure 20-8),

just to see how the code and presentation look:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plot
import matplotlib.image as image
```
```
img = image.imread('oreilly.png')
plot.imshow(img)
plot.show()
```
```
Plots, Graphs, and Visualization | 461
```

Figure 20-8. Image displayed with Matplotlib

The real strength of Matplotlib is in plotting, which is, after all, its middle name. Let’s

generate two lists of 20 integers, one smoothly increasing from 1 to 20, and another

like the first, but with slight wobbles now and then (Example 20-2).

Example 20-2. ch20_matplotlib.py

**import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from random import** randint

linear = list(range(1, 21))
wiggly = list(num + randint(-1, 1) **for** num **in** linear)

fig, plots = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=3)

ticks = list(range(0, 21, 5))
**for** plot **in** plots:
plot.set_xticks(ticks)
plot.set_yticks(ticks)

plots[0].scatter(linear, wiggly)

**462 | Chapter 20: Py Art**


plots[1].plot(linear, wiggly)
plots[2].plot(linear, wiggly, 'o-')

plt.show()

If you run this program, you’ll see something like what’s shown in Figure 20-9 (not

exactly, because the randint() calls make random wiggles).

Figure 20-9. Basic Matplotlib scatter and line plots

This example showed a scatterplot, a line plot, and a line plot with data markers. All

of the styles and colors used Matplotlib defaults, but they can be customized very

extensively. For details, see the Matplotlib site or an overview like Python Plotting

With Matplotlib (Guide).

You can see more of Matplotlib in Chapter 22; it has strong ties to NumPy and other

scientific applications.

```
Plots, Graphs, and Visualization | 463
```

#### Seaborn

Seaborn is a data visualization library (Figure 20-10), built on Matplotlib and with

connections to Pandas. The usual installation mantra (pip install seaborn) works.

Figure 20-10. Basic Seaborn scatter plot and linear regression

The code in Example 20-3 is based on a Seaborn example; it accesses test data on res‐

taurant tipping and plots tips versus total bill amounts with a fitted linear regression

line.

Example 20-3. ch20_seaborn.py

**import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt**

tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
sns.regplot(x="total_bill", y="tip", data=tips);

plt.show()

**464 | Chapter 20: Py Art**


```
If you run the preceding code with the standard Python interpreter,
you need that initial import line (import matplotlib.pyplot as
plt) and final line (plt.show()), as shown in Example 20-3, or else
the plot just won’t display. If you’re using Jupyter, Matplotlib is built
in and you don’t need to type them. Remember this when you read
code examples of Python mapping tools.
```
Like Matplotlib, Seaborn has a vast number of options for data handling and display.

#### Bokeh

In the old web days, developers would generate graphics on the server and give the

web browser some URL to access them. More recently, JavaScript has gained perfor‐

mance and client-side graphics generation tools like D3. A page or two ago, I men‐

tioned the possibility of using Python as part of a frontend-backend architecture for

graphics and GUIs. A new tool called Bokeh combines the strengths of Python (large

data sets, ease of use) and JavaScript (interactivity, less graphics latency). Its emphasis

is quick visualization of large data sets.

If you’ve already installed its prerequisites (NumPy, Pandas, and Redis), you can

install Bokeh by typing this command:

```
$ pip install bokeh
```
(You can see NumPy and Pandas in action in Chapter 22.)

Or, install everything at once from the Bokeh website. Although Matplotlib runs on

the server, Bokeh runs mainly in the browser and can take advantage of recent advan‐

ces on the client side. Click any image in the gallery for an interactive view of the dis‐

play and its Python code.

### Games

Python is such a good game development platform that people have written books

about it:

- Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python by Al Sweigart
- The Python Game Book by Horst Jens (a docuwiki book)

There’s a general discussion at the Python wiki with even more links.

The best known Python game platform is probably pygame. You can download an

executable installer for your platform from the Pygame website, and read a line-by-

line example of a “pummel the chimp” game.

### Audio and Music

```
I sought the serif
But that did not suit Claude Debussy.
—Deservedly Anonymous
```
What about sound, and music, and cats singing “Jingle Bells”? Well, as Meatloaf says,

two out of three ain’t bad.

It’s hard to represent sound in a printed book, so here are some up-to-date links to

Python packages for sound and music, but Google has many more:

- Standard library audio modules
- Third-party audio tools
- Dozens of third-party music applications: graphic and CLI players, converters,
    notation, analysis, playlists, MIDI, and more

Finally, how about some online sources of music? You’ve seen code examples

throughout this book that access the Internet Archive. Here are links to some of its

audio archives:

- Audio recordings (>5 million)
- Live music (>200,000)
- Live Grateful Dead shows (>13,000)

### Coming Up

Act busy! It’s Python in business.

### Things to Do

20.1 Install matplotlib. Draw a scatter diagram of these (x, y) pairs: ( (0, 0), (3,

5), (6, 2), (9, 8), (14, 10) ).

20.2 Draw a line graph of the same data.

20.3 Draw a plot (a line graph with markers) of the same data.

**CHAPTER 21**

**Py at Work**

```
“Business!” cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. “Mankind was my business...”
—Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol
```
The businessman’s uniform is a suit and tie. But before he can get down to business, he

tosses his jacket over a chair, loosens his tie, rolls up his sleeves, and pours some cof‐

fee. Meanwhile, the business woman has already been getting work done. Maybe with

a latte.

In business and government, we use all of the technologies from the earlier chapters

—databases, the web, systems, and networks. Python’s productivity is making it more

popular in the enterprise and with startups.

Organizations have long fought incompatible file formats, arcane network protocols,

language lock-in, and the universal lack of accurate documentation. They can create

faster, cheaper, stretchier applications by using with tools such as these:

- Dynamic languages like Python
- The web as a universal graphical user interface
- RESTful APIs as language-independent service interfaces
- Relational and NoSQL databases
- “Big data” and analytics
- Clouds for deployment and capital savings

### The Microsoft Office Suite

Business is heavily dependent on Microsoft Office applications and file formats.

Although they are not well known, and in some cases poorly documented, there are

some Python libraries that can help. Here are some that process Microsoft Office

documents:

docx

This library creates, reads, and writes Microsoft Office Word 2007 .docx files.

python-excel

```
This one discusses the xlrd, xlwt, and xlutils modules via a PDF tutorial. Excel
can also read and write comma-separated values (CSV) files, which you know
how to process by using the standard csv module.
```
oletools

This library extracts data from Office formats.

OpenOffice is an open source alternative to Office. It runs on Linux, Unix, Windows,

and macOS, and reads and writes Office file formats, It also installs a version of

Python 3 for its own use. You can program OpenOffice in Python with the PyUNO

library.

OpenOffice was owned by Sun Microsystems, and when Oracle acquired Sun, some

people feared for its future availability. LibreOffice was spun off as a result. Docu‐

mentHacker describes using the Python UNO library with LibreOffice.

OpenOffice and LibreOffice had to reverse engineer the Microsoft file formats, which

is not easy. The Universal Office Converter module depends on the UNO library in

OpenOffice or LibreOffice. It can convert many file formats: documents, spread‐

sheets, graphics, and presentations.

If you have a mystery file, python-magic can guess its format by analyzing specific

byte sequences.

The python open document library lets you provide Python code within templates to

create dynamic documents.

Although not a Microsoft format, Adobe’s PDF is very common in business.

ReportLab has open source and commercial versions of its Python-based PDF gener‐

ator. If you need to edit a PDF, you might find some help at StackOverflow.

### Carrying Out Business Tasks

You can find a Python module for almost anything. Visit PyPI and type something

into the search box. Many modules are interfaces to the public APIs of various serv‐

ices. You might be interested in some examples related to business tasks:

**468 | Chapter 21: Py at Work**


- Ship via Fedex or UPS.
- Mail with the stamps.com API.
- Read a discussion of Python for business intelligence.
- If Aeropresses are flying off the shelves in Anoka, was it customer activity or pol‐
    tergeists? Cubes is an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) web server and data
    browser.
- OpenERP is a large commercial Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system
    written in Python and JavaScript, with thousands of add-on modules.

### Processing Business Data

Businesses have a particular fondness for data. Sadly, many of them conjure up per‐

verse ways of making data harder to use.

Spreadsheets were a good invention, and over time businesses became addicted to

them. Many nonprogrammers were tricked into programming because they were

called macros instead of programs. But the universe is expanding and data is trying to

keep up. Older versions of Excel were limited to 65,536 rows, and even newer ver‐

sions choke at a million or so. When an organization’s data outgrow the limits of a

single computer, it’s like headcount growing past a hundred people or so—suddenly

you need new layers, intermediaries, and communication.

Excessive data programs aren’t caused by the size of data on single desktops; rather,

they’re the result of the aggregate of data pouring into the business. Relational data‐

bases handle millions of rows without exploding, but only so many writes or updates

at a time. A plain old text or binary file can grow gigabytes in size, but if you need to

process it all at once, you need enough memory. Traditional desktop software isn’t

designed for all this. Companies such as Google and Amazon had to invent solutions

to handle so much data at scale. Netflix is an example built on Amazon’s AWS cloud,

using Python to glue together RESTful APIs, security, deployment, and databases.

#### Extracting, Transforming, and Loading

The underwater portions of the data icebergs include all the work to get the data in

the first place. If you speak enterprise, the common term is extract, transform, load,

or ETL. Synonyms such as data munging or data wrangling give the impression of

taming an unruly beast, which might be apt metaphors. This would seem to be a

solved engineering matter by now, but it remains largely an art. I talked a bit about

this in Chapter 12. We address data science more broadly in Chapter 22, because this

is where most developers spend a large part of their time.

```
Processing Business Data | 469
```

If you’ve seen The Wizard of Oz, you probably remember (besides the flying mon‐

keys) the part at the end—when the good witch told Dorothy that she could always go

home to Kansas just by clicking her ruby slippers. Even when I was young I thought,

“Now she tells her!” Although, in retrospect, I realize the movie would have been

much shorter if she’d shared that tip earlier.

But this isn’t a movie; we’re talking about the world of business here, where making

tasks shorter is a good thing. So, let me share some tips with you now. Most of the

tools that you need for day-to-day data work in business are those that you’ve already

read about here. Those include high-level data structures such as dictionaries and

objects, thousands of standard and third-party libraries, and an expert community

that’s just a google away.

If you’re a computer programmer working for some business, your workflow almost

always includes the following:

1. Extracting data from weird file formats or databases
2. “Cleaning up” the data, which covers a lot of ground, all strewn with pointy
    objects
3. Converting things like dates, times, and character sets
4. Actually doing something with the data
5. Storing resulting data in a file or database
6. Rolling back to step 1 again; lather, rinse, repeat

Here’s an example: you want to move data from a spreadsheet to a database. You can

save the spreadsheet in CSV format and use the Python libraries from Chapter 16. Or,

you can look for a module that reads the binary spreadsheet format directly. Your fin‐

gers know how to type python excel into Google and find sites such as Working

with Excel files in Python. You can install one of the packages by using pip, and

locate a Python database driver for the last part of the task. I mentioned SQLAlchemy

and the direct low-level database drivers in that same chapter. Now you need some

code in the middle, and that’s where Python’s data structures and libraries can save

you time.

Let’s try an example here, and then we’ll try again with a library that saves a few steps.

We’ll read a CSV file, aggregate the counts in one column by unique values in

another, and print the results. If we did this in SQL, we would use SELECT, JOIN,

and GROUP BY.

First, the file, zoo.csv, which has columns for the type of animal, how many times it

has bitten a visitor, the number of stitches required, and how much we’ve paid the

visitor not to tell local television stations:

**470 | Chapter 21: Py at Work**


```
animal,bites,stitches,hush
bear,1,35,300
marmoset,1,2,250
bear,2,42,500
elk,1,30,100
weasel,4,7,50
duck,2,0,10
```
We want to see which animal is costing us the most, so we aggregate the total hush

money by the type of animal. (We’ll leave bites and stitches to an intern.) We use the

csv module from “CSV” on page 304 and Counter from “Count Items with

Counter()” on page 209. Save this code as zoo_counts.py:

```
import csv
from collections import Counter
```
```
counts = Counter()
with open('zoo.csv', 'rt') as fin:
cin = csv.reader(fin)
for num, row in enumerate(cin):
if num > 0:
counts[row[0]] += int(row[-1])
for animal, hush in counts.items():
print ("%10s %10s" % (animal, hush))
```
We skipped the first row because it contained only the column names. counts is a

Counter object, and takes care of initializing the sum for each animal to zero. We also

applied a little formatting to right-align the output. Let’s try it:

```
$ python zoo_counts.py
duck 10
elk 100
bear 800
weasel 50
marmoset 250
```
Hah! It was the bear. He was our prime suspect all along, but now we have the

numbers.

Next, let’s replicate this with a data processing toolkit called Bubbles. You can install it

by typing this command:

```
$ pip install bubbles
```
It requires SQLAlchemy; if you don’t have that, pip install sqlalchemy will do the

trick. Here’s the test program (call it bubbles1.py), adapted from the documentation:

```
import bubbles
```
```
p = bubbles.Pipeline()
p.source(bubbles.data_object('csv_source', 'zoo.csv', infer_fields=True))
p.aggregate('animal', 'hush')
p.pretty_print()
```
```

And now, the moment of truth:

```

If you read the documentation, you can avoid those debug print lines, and maybe

change the format of the table.

Looking at the two examples, we see that the bubbles example used a single function

call (aggregate) to replace our manual reading and counting of the CSV format.

Depending on your needs, data toolkits can save a lot of work.

In a more realistic example, our zoo file might have thousands of rows (it’s a danger‐

ous place), with misspellings such as bare, commas in numbers, and so on. For good

examples of practical data problems with Python code, I’d also recommend the

following:

- Data Crunching: Solve Everyday Problems Using Java, Python, and More—Greg
    Wilson (Pragmatic Bookshelf ).
- Automate the Boring Stuff—Al Sweigart (No Starch).

Data cleanup tools can save a lot of time, and Python has many of them. For another

example, PETL does row and column extraction and renaming. Its related work page

lists many useful modules and products. Chapter 22 has detailed discussions of some

especially useful data tools: Pandas, NumPy, and IPython. Although they’re currently

best known among scientists, they’re becoming popular among financial and data

developers. At the 2012 Pydata conference, AppData discussed how these three and

other Python tools help process 15 terabytes of data daily. Python handles very large

real-world data loads.

You may also look back at the data serialization and validation tools discussed in

“Data Serialization” on page 361.

#### Data Validation

When cleaning up data, you’ll often need to check:

**472 | Chapter 21: Py at Work**


- Data type, such as integer, float, or string
- Range of values
- Correct values, such as a working phone number or email address
- Duplicates
- Missing data

This is especially common when processing web requests and responses.

Useful Python packages for particular data types include:

- validate_email
- phonenumber

Some useful general tools are:

- validators
- pydantic—For Python 3.6 and above; uses type hints
- marshmallow—Also serializes and deserializes
- cerberus
- many others

#### Additional Sources of Information

Sometimes, you need data that originates somewhere else. Some business and gov‐

ernment data sources include:

data.gov

```
A gateway to thousands of data sets and tools. Its APIs are built on CKAN, a
Python data management system.
```

### Business Data Security

Security is a special concern for business. Entire books are devoted to this topic, so we

just mention a few Python-related tips here.

**474 | Chapter 21: Py at Work**


- “Scapy” on page 349 discusses scapy, a Python-powered language for packet for‐
    ensics. It has been used to explain some major network attacks.
- The Python Security site has discussions of security topics, details on some
    Python modules, and cheat sheets.
- The book Violent Python (subtitled A Cookbook for Hackers, Forensic Analysts,
    Penetration Testers and Security Engineers) by TJ O’Connor (Syngress) is an
    extensive review of Python and computer security.

### Maps

Maps have become valuable to many businesses. Python is very good at making

maps, so we’re going to spend a little more time in this area. Managers love graphics,

and if you can quickly whip up a nice map for your organization’s website it wouldn’t

hurt.

In the early days of the web, I used to visit an experimental mapmaking website at

Xerox. When big sites such as Google Maps came along, they were a revelation (along

the lines of “why didn’t I think of that and make millions?”). Now mapping and

location-based services are everywhere, and are particularly useful in mobile devices.

Many terms overlap here: mapping, cartography, GIS (geographic information sys‐

tem), GPS (Global Positioning System), geospatial analysis, and many more. The blog

at Geospatial Python has an image of the “800-pound gorilla” systems—GDAL/OGR,

GEOS, and PROJ.4 (projections)—and surrounding systems, represented as mon‐

keys. Many of these have Python interfaces. Let’s talk about some of these, beginning

with the simplest formats.

#### Formats

The mapping world has lots of formats: vector (lines), raster (images), metadata

(words), and various combinations.

Esri, a pioneer of geographic systems, invented the shapefile format over 20 years ago.

A shapefile actually consists of multiple files, including at the very least the following:

.shp

The “shape” (vector) information

.shx

The shape index

.dbf

An attribute database

```
Maps | 475
```

Let’s grab a shapefile for our next example—visit the Natural Earth 1:110m Cultural

Vectors page. Under “Admin 1 - States and Provinces,” click the green download

states and provinces box to download a zip file. After it downloads to your computer,

unzip it; you should see these resulting files:

```
ne_110m_admin_1_states_provinces_shp.README.html
ne_110m_admin_1_states_provinces_shp.sbn
ne_110m_admin_1_states_provinces_shp.VERSION.txt
ne_110m_admin_1_states_provinces_shp.sbx
ne_110m_admin_1_states_provinces_shp.dbf
ne_110m_admin_1_states_provinces_shp.shp
ne_110m_admin_1_states_provinces_shp.prj
ne_110m_admin_1_states_provinces_shp.shx
```
We’ll use these for our examples.

#### Draw a Map from a Shapefile

This section is an overly simplified demonstration of reading and displaying a shape‐

file. You’ll see that the result has problems, and that you’d be better off working with a

higher-level mapping package, such as those in the sections that follow.

You’ll need this library to read a shapefile:

```
$ pip install pyshp
```
Now for the program, map1.py, which I’ve modified from a Geospatial Python blog

post:

```
def display_shapefile(name, iwidth=500, iheight=500):
import shapefile
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
r = shapefile.Reader(name)
mleft, mbottom, mright, mtop = r.bbox
# map units
mwidth = mright - mleft
mheight = mtop - mbottom
# scale map units to image units
hscale = iwidth/mwidth
vscale = iheight/mheight
img = Image.new("RGB", (iwidth, iheight), "white")
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
for shape in r.shapes():
pixels = [
(int(iwidth - ((mright - x) * hscale)), int((mtop - y) * vscale))
for x, y in shape.points]
if shape.shapeType == shapefile.POLYGON:
draw.polygon(pixels, outline='black')
elif shape.shapeType == shapefile.POLYLINE:
draw.line(pixels, fill='black')
img.show()
```
**476 | Chapter 21: Py at Work**


```
if __name__ == '__main__':
import sys
display_shapefile(sys.argv[1], 700, 700)
```
This reads the shapefile and iterates through its individual shapes. I’m checking for

only two shape types: a polygon, which connects the last point to the first, and a poly‐

line, which doesn’t. I’ve based my logic on the original post and a quick look at the

documentation for pyshp, so I’m not really sure how it will work. Sometimes, we just

need to make a start and deal with any problems as we find them.

So, let’s run it. The argument is the base name of the shapefile files, without any

extension:

```
$ python map1.py ne_110m_admin_1_states_provinces_shp
```
You should see something like Figure 21-1.

Well, it drew a map that resembles the United States, but:

- It looks like a cat dragged yarn across Alaska and Hawaii; this is a bug.
- The country is squished; I need a projection.
- The picture isn’t pretty; I need better style control.

```
Maps | 477
```

Figure 21-1. Preliminary map

To address the first point: I have a problem somewhere in my logic, but what should I

do? Chapter 19 discusses development tips, including debugging, but we can consider

other options here. I could write some tests and bear down until I fix this, or I could

just try some other mapping library. Maybe something at a higher level would solve

all three of my problems (the stray lines, squished appearance, and primitive style).

As far as I can tell, there is no bare-bones pure Python mapping package. Luckily,

there are some fancier ones, so let’s take a look.

**478 | Chapter 21: Py at Work**


#### Geopandas

Geopandas integrates matplotlib, pandas, and other Python libraries into a geospa‐

tial data platform.

The base package is installed with the familiar pip install geopandas, but it relies

on other packages that you will also need to install with pip if you don’t have them

already:

- numpy
- pandas (version 0.23.4 or later)
- shapely (interface to GEOS)
- fiona (interface to GDAL)
- pyproj (interface to PROJ)
- six

Geopandas can read shapefiles (including those from the previous section), and

handily includes two from Natural Earth: country/continent outlines, and national

capital cities. Example 21-1 is a simple demo that uses both of them.

Example 21-1. geopandas.py

**import geopandas
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt**

world_file = geopandas.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_lowres')
world = geopandas.read_file(world_file)
cities_file = geopandas.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_cities')
cities = geopandas.read_file(cities_file)
base = world.plot(color='orchid')
cities.plot(ax=base, color='black', markersize=2)
plt.show()

Run that, and you should get the map shown in Figure 21-2.

```
Maps | 479
```

Figure 21-2. Geopandas map

To me, geopandas currently looks like the best combination for geographic data man‐

agement and display. But there are many worthy contenders, which we look at in the

next section.

#### Other Mapping Packages

Here’s a grab bag of links to other Python mapping software; many cannot be

installed fully with pip, but some can with conda (the alternative Python package

installer that’s especially handy for scientific software):

pyshp

```
A pure-Python shapefile library, mentioned earlier in “Draw a Map from a
Shapefile” on page 476.
```
kartograph

Renders shapefiles into SVG maps on the server or client.

**480 | Chapter 21: Py at Work**


shapely

```
Addresses geometric questions such as, “What buildings in this town are within
the 50-year flood contour?”
```
basemap

```
Based on matplotlib, draws maps and data overlays. Unfortunately, it has been
deprecated in favor of Cartopy.
```
cartopy

Succeeds Basemap, and does some of the things that geopandas does.

folium

Works with leaflet.js, used by geopandas.

plotly

Another plotting package that includes mapping features.

dash

```
Uses Plotly, Flask and JavaScript to create interactive visualizations, including
maps.

If you’re interested in maps, try downloading and installing one of these packages and

see what you can do. Or, you can avoid installing software and try connecting to a

remote web service API yourself; Chapter 18 shows you how to connect to web

servers and decode JSON responses.

#### Applications and Data

I’ve been talking about drawing maps, but you can do a lot more with map data. Geo‐

coding converts between addresses and geographic coordinates. There are many geo‐

coding APIs (see ProgrammableWeb’s comparison) and Python libraries:

- geopy
- pygeocoder
- googlemaps

If you sign up with Google or another source to get an API key, you can access other

services such as step-by-step travel directions or local search.

Here are a few sources of mapping data:

Vector and raster map data at three scales

I should mention the Data Science Toolkit here. It includes free bidirectional geocod‐

ing, coordinates to political boundaries and statistics, and more. You can also down‐

load all the data and software as a virtual machine (VM) and run it self-contained on

your own computer.
